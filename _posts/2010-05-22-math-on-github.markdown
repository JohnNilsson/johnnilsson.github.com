This page is written in [Markdown] and then processed by [Jekyll] into
HTML when pushed to GitHub.

To render a mathematical expression [MathJax] is used. Mathematical
expression are simply written in LaTeX and MathJax will hande the rest.

<p>Example: When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$</p>
